I want to make a simple web game about plastic waste on Vietnam’s coasts. Give me 5 ideas using board/card/dice mechanics that teach real actions communities can take.
I like the memory matching idea. Propose 8 Problem ↔ Solution pairs that are realistic in Vietnam (English labels).
Write one sentence per pair explaining how the solution addresses the problem.
